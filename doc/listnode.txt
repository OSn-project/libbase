To simplify the utilisation of linked lists, libbase has a `BListNode` struct that should be interited by any class wanting to be linked into a list.
The `BListNode struct consists of a `next` and a `prev` pointer, pointing to the next and previous nodes in the list, respectively:

	struct BListNode
	{
		BListNode *next;
		BListNode *prev;
		
		/* ... */
	}

It also contains functions that .. simplify manipulation of linked lists for the programmer.
